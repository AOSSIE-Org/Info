# Communication Guidelines and Rules

* AOSSIE's official communication channels are:
    * [AOSSIE's Main Discord](https://discord.gg/xnmAPS7zqB).
    * [Stability Nexus's Discord](https://discord.gg/fuuWX4AbJt), for projects related to blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

* All communication should happen in the official communication channels, to ensure openness and visibility to all organization members.

* Communication through DMs should be avoided, unless in cases that require privacy.

* Communication through DMs between mentors and prospective candidates for funding programs (e.g. GSoC) is strictly forbidden, to avoid biases and conflicts of interest in the selection.
    * If you are a mentor and you are contacted by a prospective candidate privately, please instruct them to contact you through one of our official communication channels.
    * We recommend that you update your personal privacy settings in Discord to forbid DMs.
    * Violation of this rule may lead to ineligibility of the prospective candidate.
    * If you suspect that this rule is being violated by others, please inform them about these guidelines and contact the admins.
 
* Gate keeping is not appreciated at all.

* Clearly state what you plan to work on and how before starting. Collaborate with others working in the same area.

* Duplicate issues or PRs indicate unawareness and insufficient project review.

* Any attempt to harass or offend any participant in our communication channels will lead to banning from these channels.

* Please adhere to our [AI Usage Policy](AI-UsagePolicy.md).
