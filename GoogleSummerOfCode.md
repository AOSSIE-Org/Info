# Google Summer of Code

AOSSIE has been participating in Google Summer of Code since 2016 and some of our admins and mentors have been participating since 2011. 
We are grateful for the support that Google has provided to our organization over all these years.
We abide strictly by all the rules of the GSoC program, to uphold the excellence of the program. 
In addition to the rules, terms and conditions required by Google, 
AOSSIE also requires all mentors and contributors to abide to the guidelines and rules described below.


## AOSSIE Repos

AOSSIE is an umbrella organization for projects hosted under the following GitHub spaces:

* https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org
* https://github.com/StabilityNexus
* https://github.com/DjedAlliance

Contributions to repos in any of these spaces count for GSoC selection.


## Selection Criteria

The main selection criteria are:

* Pull Requests made to projects in any of the above-mentioned github spaces.
   * We take into account the quality, quantity and difficulty of the submitted PRs.
      * Quality of the PR involves not only quality of the code itself, but also of the PR's scope, the PR's description and PR's readiness.
      * Submitting PR with code that was AI-generated is allowed, but you must be responsible for the code. Use AI responsibly.
      * Spamming our repos with untested, broken, AI-generated code will make you ineligible.
   * We also take into account whether the submitted PRs demonstrate that you have the skill to do what you are proposing.
      * While using AI to genrate code is allowed and even encouraged, since it may increase productivity, we are looking for contributors who are more than just "AI pilots".
   * We also take into account your behavior during the PR review process, such as your ability to improve your PR based on feedback in our reviews of your PR.
   * Pull requests made to any of our projects count, even the project is not related to your proposal or if the project is not going to participate in GSoC. In fact, we like contributors who contribute to our organization as a whole and not just to a single project. 
* Quality of the Proposal
   * AI-generated spam proposals will have no chance of acceptance.
   * Our GSoC ideas are intentionally a bit vague, so that you need to fill many gaps yourself with the help of mentors during the application phase.

We also take mentoring capacity and project capacity into account. So, if too many candidates apply with proposals related to the same project and 
that project does not have capacity to have many contributors simultaenously or does not have enough mentors, then we may be unable to select even excellent candidates.


# Rules to Ensure Fairness and Prevent Conflicts of Interest

AOSSIE is interested in selecting the best contributors according to the criteria above. Favoritism, bias and conflict of interest have no place in our selection process.

Our rules to prevent conflicts of interests are stricter than Google's. In addition to all the rules by Google, AOSSIE's mentors, contributors and candidates must also respect the foloowing to be eligible:

* All communications between mentors and candidates must occur through our communication channels. See our [Communication Guidelines and Rules](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Info/blob/main/CommunicationGuidelinesAndRules.md) for more details.
* A contributor cannot be mentored by a mentor from the same university or city.
* A contributor who participated in GSoC in a previous year with AOSSIE is not eligible to apply again for GSoC with AOSSIE.

If you suspect that these rules are being violated, please contact AOSSIE's admins.
