# AOSSIE's Policy for the Usage of AI

AI usage is accepted and encouraged for:

* Improving your communication skills.
* Researching and brainstorming ideas and solutions.
* Generating code.
* Generating PR descriptions.
* Reviewing code.

However, please adhere to the following principles:

* You remain responsible for your AI usage.

* You should disclose the usage of AI.

 
Please respect the following rules, which are derived from the principles above:

* When raising ideas or solutions that were generated with the help of AI, 
  you should disclose the AI usage and should not present them as your own.
  - For example: "I have asked AI model M to suggest solutions for problem P. It suggested A, B and C. 
    I think that B is the most promising approach for reasons R and S." is acceptable. 
    But "For solving problem P, I suggest that we try A, B and C." 
    (when A, B and C were suggested by AI model M) is not acceptable.
  - This rule applies to any form of communication. In particular, it also applies for:
     - messages in our communication channels.
     - project proposals (e.g. GSoC proposals).

* Please test any AI-generated code locally before submitting a PR.
  - We encorage you to use AI tools not only to generate code, 
    but also to review your code locally before submitting a PR.

* When submitting a PR that contains AI-generated code, please write a short paragraph in the PR descriptions,
  explaining which models were used and how you used them.
  - Our PR template contains a section for this.

* AOSSIE uses CodeRabbit to assist maintainers in reviewing PRs. 
  As a maintainer, you are still responsible for the decision to merge a PR, 
  even if CodeRabbit approved it.

* AOSSIE's usage of CodeRabbit is also intended to help contributors ensure the quality of their PRs.
  As a contributor, ensure that you have addressed all comments by CodeRabbit before requesting review by a human
  maintainer. Note that CodeRabbit is not always right. If you decide to ignore an unsuitable suggestion by CodeRabbit, 
  please justify your decision with a reply to CodeRabbit's comment.


A final remark:

* AI is your tool. You are not AI's tool.
* As a contributor, avoid becoming merely an intermediary between maintainers and AI.



This is AOSSIE's general policy. Each project by AOSSIE may have its own 
AI Usage Policies that may extend or override AOSSIE's general policy. 
Look for `AI-UsagePolicy.md` files in each project's repo.
