Please follow these accounts and tag them on any LinkedIn post that relates to their respective projects.

As open organizations, we welcome contributions from anyone and we encourage contributors to list these organizations 
in the experience section of their LinkedIn profiles. Please abide to the following rules:

* The fundamental principle is: do not misrepresent your affiliation to or your role within our organizations.
  - If the org admins or founders determine that you are misrepresenting your involvement in
    our organizations in your LinkedIn profile and request you to make changes, please comply.

* In order to be allowed to add any of these organizations to your profile,
  you should have made at least 1 contribution (e.g. have 1 PR merged,
  mentored one contributor who had 1 PR merged, completed one admin task, evangelized AOSSIE at least once, ...) 
  - Display roles that correctly describe your contributions.
    Examples: "Contributor", "Apprentice", "Knight", "Software Developer", "Software Architect", 
    "Designer", "Full-Stack Developer", "Mobile Developer", "Frontend Developer", 
    "Blockchain Developer", "AI Developer", "Evangelist", "Ambassador", "Mentor", "Admin", ...
  - The start date for your role can be any date after the acceptance of your 1st contribution related to that role.
  - The end date for your role must be at most 6 months after the last contribution related to that role.
  - The special role "Member" does not have any end date. You may keep this role forever (after your first contribution),
    unless you are expelled by an admin or founder.
