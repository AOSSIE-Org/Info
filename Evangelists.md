# Evangelists

AOSSIE is starting an evangelist program in 2026.
Evangelists are University Students responsible for promoting AOSSIE in various universities.


## Eligibility to be an AOSSIE Evangelist

To be an evangelist, you must:
* be a part of a university with atleast a year of active education remaining.
* be an active organizing/managing member of an open-source student community or club recognized by your university.

You do not need to be an active contributor or mentor at AOSSIE.

## Responsibilities of an Evangelist

As an Evangelist, you should:
* advertise AOSSIE's participation in coding programs (e.g. Google Summer of Code) to students in your university.
* guide prospective contributors from your university regarding inquiries they might have about AOSSIE.
* ensure that prospective contributors from your university or region are aware of and respect AOSSIE's rules and guidelines.
