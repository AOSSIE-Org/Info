# Evangelists

AOSSIE is starting an ambassador program in 2026.
Another part of this program are Evangelists, who are University Students responsible for representing and promoting AOSSIE in various universities and regions of the world along with the Ambassador for that University.


## Eligibility to be an AOSSIE Evangelist

To be an evangelist, you must:
* be a part of a university which has an AOSSIE Ambassador.
* have had contributed to AOSSIE's projects atleast once and have relevant experience of helping to manage a student community.
* must be a part of an active student community related to Open Source as recognised by your university.
* be a student at the university with atleast an year of active education remaining, for which you are evangelist. 

You do not need to be an active contributor or mentor.

## Responsibilities of an Evangelist

As an Evangelist, you should:
* advertise AOSSIE's participation in coding programs (e.g. Google Summer of Code) to students in your university.
* guide prospective contributors from your university regarding inquiries they might have about AOSSIE.
* ensure that prospective contributors from your university or region are aware of and respect AOSSIE's rules and guidelines.

All communication between you and contributors or prospective contributors from your university must happen publicly in AOSSIE's discord servers.

If you are eligible and would like to apply to be an evangelist, create a PR adding your name to the table above.

If you are a prospective contributor from a university or region where AOSSIE still does not have an ambassador, 
you are welcome to contact any ambassador from the closest university or region. AOSSIE is keen to expand to as many regions as possible. 
Start contributing and you may eventually fill the gap and become the ambassador/evangelist for your university or region.
