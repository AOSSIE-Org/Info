# Social Media Guidelines

The following guidelines are designed 
to maximize the reach of our posts 
and ensure branding uniformity.

## General Guidelines

Our social media posts should include a static image, a gif or a video. 
If you have an image/gif/video that is related to the content of your post (e.g. a screenshot of something you have done, a diagram, a chart, a demo...), use it. 
If you don't have an image/gif that is related to the content of your post, create it.

If you create an image/gif, it should contain a nice background, AOSSIE's logo and the logo of your project. 
Optionally, it may contain some short text related to the content of your tweet.
The colors of the background should be compatible with the [colors of AOSSIE's logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_colours_of_Australia) (#00843D and #FFCD00) and with the colors of your project's logo. 
The contrast should be sufficient for the backgrounds to be visible.


## Twitter/X

When posting a tweet about an AOSSIE project:

1. Include the image/gif in the tweet. 
2. In the included image/gif, tag:
   * [@aossie_org](https://x.com/aossie_org).
   * any other accounts that are relevant for your project. (See list below.)
   * influential colleagues, people and organizations, who could help by retweeting.
3. Retweet your tweet using [@aossie_org](https://x.com/aossie_org)'s account.
   * Please consider waiting at least 6 hours since the last post from AOSSIE's account to post your retweet. 

In order to be able to retweet from AOSSIE's account, please configure your twitter's account to accept delegation invitations
and ask AOSSIE's admins to delegate access of AOSSIE's account to your twitter account.

If you would like to create a Twitter account for your own project, please contact AOSSIE's admins first.

Note that people rarely read the next tweets of a thread beyond the first one. Therefore, it is better to write a single very good short tweet than a long thread.
