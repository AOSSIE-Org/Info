# Proposal: Interactive Quiz Experience for EduAid

## Overview

EduAid (https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/EduAid) is highly effective at generating high-quality quizzes from educational content. To extend its impact beyond static quiz consumption, this proposal explores the idea of introducing an **interactive quiz experience** directly within the platform.

The goal is to increase engagement while preserving EduAid’s existing static quiz functionality.

## Motivation

Static quizzes are valuable for focused, individual learning. However, adding an optional interactive mode can:
- Encourage active participation
- Improve revision through real-time feedback
- Make learning more engaging without compromising academic intent

This feature is envisioned as an **additional learning mode**, not a replacement for current quiz workflows.

## High-Level Concept

The interactive mode introduces a **shared quiz experience** where multiple participants answer the same set of generated questions in real time.

Key characteristics:
- Time-based responses
- Immediate feedback
- Lightweight competitive elements to maintain engagement

## Initial Scope

To keep the implementation simple and accessible, the first iteration may focus on:
- Local participation
- Single-device interaction
- Minimal UI complexity

This allows for early experimentation while gathering user feedback.

## Coexistence with Static Quizzes

This feature is designed to **coexist with static quizzes**, which will continue to:
- Support individual study
- Enable offline or asynchronous usage
- Serve as the primary quiz generation output

Users can choose the learning mode that best fits their needs.

## Benefits

- Higher engagement during revision
- Supports collaborative learning scenarios
- Encourages repeated practice
- Expands EduAid’s usage without altering its core purpose

## Conclusion

An interactive quiz mode has the potential to enhance EduAid’s learning experience while maintaining its current strengths. Further details and refinements can be explored incrementally based on feasibility and user feedback.
