# Order-Book Auction-Based Exchange

In GSoC 2025, we have built an auction platform (Hammer) and an auction-based liquidity pool exchange (Maelstrom). 

Auctions are a key mechanism for proper price discovery and thus are essential for stability in highly volatile cryptocurrency markets.

In GSoC 2026, we would like to continue our research and development in the area of auctions and we suggest building a 
variation of Maelstrom that is based on order books instead of liquidity pools.
