# Ellena

## Background and Motivation
Ell-ena is an AI-powered product manager that automates task management by creating to-do items, tickets, and transcribing meetings while maintaining full work context. 

It is input-agnostic and features a chat interface where users can interact naturally.

## Overview of Tasks

#### Web Version - Use Flutter for Web
We have a mobile app in place currently. Need to deploy a web version considering most clients would also be sitting at their desktops and work with their product requirements, attend meetings and more.

#### GitHub + Issue Tracker Native Intelligence
Integrate Github to automate issue and PR lifecycle on Github directly. Opening an Engineering labelled issue on Ellena kanban board should directly open a Github issue. Creating a PR for that issue, should move the ticket on the kanban board to "In review" status. Once the PR is merged, the ticket should be moved to "Done" status.


#### Unit testing and Integration testing
Add tests to the project. Makes feature development and bug fixing less error prone.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.
