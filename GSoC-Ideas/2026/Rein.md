# Improving Cross-Platform Remote Input Reliability

## Background and Motivation

[Rein](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Rein) is a **cross-platform, LAN-based remote input controller**. It allows touchscreen devices to act as a trackpad and keyboard for a desktop system through a locally served web interface.

While the core functionality is already implemented, several areas require improvement to ensure consistent behavior across operating systems, display protocols, and input methods.

---

## Overview of Tasks

* **Evaluate and Replace NutJS with Better Options** *(Highest Priority)*

  * Resolve cursor position desynchronization on Wayland (e.g., KDE).
  * Investigate virtual input devices or alternative input injection methods.
  * Ensure native OS handling of cursor movement, scrolling, and gestures.
  * Ensure the cursor position is either correctly synced or reliably indicated.

<!-- Already done
* **Improve keyboard input handling**

  * Ensure consistent multi-character input (e.g., glide typing, voice input).
-->

* **Complete and normalize key mappings**

  * Modifier keys, navigation keys, function keys, and media keys.

* **Ensure cross-platform compatibility**

  * Test across operating systems and display protocols.
  * Automate creation of distributables for all supported platforms
    (Linux must be distributed as a Flatpak).
  * Document platform-specific limitations and behavior.

<!-- Already done
* **Authentication**

  * Use an authentication token passed via URL (link and QR code).

  * Persist tokens on the server after successful connection.

  * Expire tokens after a defined period of inactivity.
-->

* **Low Latency Audio & Screen mirror**

  * Explore possibility of screen mirroring on the trackpad region, i.e. cursor movement should be possible over the mirror itself.

* **Improve UI/UX**

  * Make the interface more intuitive and easier to use.

* **Propose Significant Improvements (Beyond LLM-Generated Suggestions)**

  * Identify areas where unnecessary complexity can be reduced.
  * Suggest simpler, more maintainable implementations where applicable.
  * Highlight sections that would benefit from using well-suited libraries instead of custom logic.


<!-- Added complexity might not be worth it, will reconsider this in future
* **Improve LAN accessibility**

  * Enable stable LAN access without relying on changing IP addresses, which currently requires re-scanning.
  * This'll help when system input fails and the app is configured to auto-start.
-->

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals and discuss their approaches with peers instead of directly raising PRs.

## Requirements

### Technical Skills

* Familiarity with the current stack:
  **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **WebSockets**, **TanStack**, **Nut.js**
* Understanding of input injection and virtual input devices.
* Experience with **cross-platform packaging of Node.js applications**.
* Ability to test across different operating systems and environments
  (using VMs), including **Linux, macOS, Windows**, and potentially others.

### Proposal Expectations

* Shows strong understanding of current limitations and the **end-to-end solution flow**.
* Defines decision points and trade-offs, ideally with **diagrams**.
* Evaluates alternative libraries or approaches for better reliability and compatibility.
* Provides timeline utilizing the full GSoC period.
* Outlines future scope and long-term direction.
* Preferably include link to a video (e.g., on YouTube or any public platform) showcasing the app, its features, overall vision, and a brief explanation of its internal workings.

### General Abilities

* Ability to take ownership and work autonomously.
* Evaluate technical decisions and the existing stack against alternatives.
* Maintain cross-platform behavior and compatibility.
* Record demos or tutorials when appropriate.
* Produce clear documentation, including diagrams and architecture overviews.
* Help grow the user base through community and social channels.
