# Discord/Github Bot

## Background and Motivation

As our organizations are becoming larger, it is becoming increasingly more time-consuming and harder to manually manage our Discords and our Github orgs.

We need a bot capable of automating what we do in both Discord and GitHub and, especialy, in the interaction between the two.

## Overview of Tasks

* Implement a Discord/Github bot.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.

## Requirements

* The bot should be executable on any computer. It should not be necessary to host the bot on some cloud server.
* The bot should not be required to be online all the time.
* The bot should be capable of assigning roles in Discord based on activity observed in GitHub.
* The bot should be capable of assigning issues and PR reviews to users that have specific roles in Discord.
* The bot should be capable of keeping track of contributions of users and assign scores/tokens to users based on these contributions.
* The bot should be configurable and generable enough so that it is useful not only to our own orgs, but to other open-source orgs.
