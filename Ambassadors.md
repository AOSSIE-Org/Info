# Ambassadors

AOSSIE is starting an ambassador program in 2026. 
Ambassadors are AOSSIE contributors responsible for representing and promoting AOSSIE in various universities and regions of the world.


## Eligibility to be an AOSSIE Ambassador

To be an ambassador, you must:
* have been a contributor to AOSSIE's projects for at least 9 months.
* be or have been a student at the university for which you are ambassador; or live or have lived in the region for which you are an ambassador. 

You do not need to be an active contributor or mentor.

## Responsibilities of an Ambassador

As an ambassador, you should:
* advertise AOSSIE's participation in coding programs (e.g. Google Summer of Code) to student clubs in their universities.
* guide prospective contributors from your university or region regarding inquiries they might have about AOSSIE.
* ensure that contributors and prospective contributors from your university or region are aware of and respect AOSSIE's rules and guidelines.

All communication between you and contributors or prospective contributors from your university or region must happen publicly in AOSSIE's discord servers.

If you are eligible and would like to apply to be an ambassador, create a PR adding your name to the table above.

If you are a prospective contributor from a unviersity or region where AOSSIE still does not have an ambassador, 
you are welcome to contact any ambassador from the closest university or region. AOSSIE is keen to expand to as many regions as possible. 
Start contributing and you may eventually fill the gap and become the ambassador for your university or region.
