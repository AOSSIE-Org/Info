# Contribution Guidelines

* Follow the CONTRIBUTING.md file of the repo to which you are contributing.
  - If the repo does not have a CONTRIBUTING.md file, then follow the recommendations in the [standard CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Template-Repo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

* Gatekeeping (i.e. preventing others from contributing) is not appreciated. Instead of trying to solve all issues at once, focus on and completely resolve one issue at a time.

* Do not create duplicate issues or duplicate PRs. This indicates unawareness and insufficient project review.

* Comply with our [AI Usage Policy](AI-UsagePolicy).

* Clearly state what you plan to work on and how before starting. Collaborate with others working in the same area.
